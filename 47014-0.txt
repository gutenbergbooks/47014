    The feminine personage who occupies the principal place in
    this romance whose pages you are about to turn, is an antique
    courtesan, but be reassured, she will not convert herself.

    She will be loved neither by a monk, a prophet or a God. In
    actual literature, this is an originality.

    Rather she will be frankly a courtesan, the ardor and also the
    pride of every human being who has vocation and who holds in
    society a freely chosen place; she will have ambition to raise
    herself to the highest point; she will not even imagine a need
    for excuse or mystery in her life.

    If the Thousand and One Days are not such splendid stories as
    The Thousand and One Nights, what stories in the world are so
    splendid? We may love the (The Thousand and One Nights) with
    all our hearts, and yet be willing to welcome The Thousand and
    One Days for the sake of that enchanted and enchanting Orient

17 Amatory. For a Night. By Emile Zola. Translated by Alison M.
    Lederer. 8vo. cloth. Phila., 1911. =$1.00=

    The imaginative realism, the poetic psychology, of this
    story of the abnormal Therese who kills her lover; of the
    simple-minded Julien who becomes an accessory after the act for
    love of her, and finally "let himself fall" into the river,
    having first dropped the body of Colombel over, are gripping
    and intense.

    This volume contains two other typical Zola stories: The Maid
    of the Dawber and Complements--two delightful, crisp bits of
    literature.


18 Amatory. The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay (Frances

20 Amatory. Sonnets from the Patagonian. 8vo. boards, uncut.
    Phila., 1918. =$2.00=

    Limited to 750 copies printed on Italian hand-made paper. This
    volume when it first appeared was not liked by divers nice
    people--it was thought nasty--but none put it down till he had

    terror was the sword of Beauty which slayeth all.

22 Amatory. Two Deaths in the Bronx. By Donald Evans. 8vo.
    boards, antique wove paper. Philadelphia, 1918. =$1.50=

    The modernism, mistakenly called Futurism, that in the Sonnets
    from the Patagonian sometimes merely amazed, in the present
    instance, stimulates and satisfies. The volume is a series of
    pitiless photographs of profligate men and women who fritter
    away life, seeking new pleasures, new sensations. It is a
    gallery of incurable poseurs. A curious little volume.


22A Amatory. The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter. (Scenes de la
    Vie de Boheme.) By Henri Murger. A literal translation into

    Vol. II, Rinaldo, the Doctor of Florence, a play in 5 acts.
    Chatterton, a 1-act play. Sonnets.

    These three plays and sixty-odd sonnets are written with
    lucidity and emotion. A human heart throbs through them. The
    sonnets have evoked a fine critical eulogy from the greatest
    student of the Elizabethan sonnets (including Shakespeare's).


23A Amatory. The Lady with the Camellias. By Alexander Dumas,
    fils. UNEXPURGATED EDITION. With portrait and several fine

    and refinement, but ultimately followed the course of so many
    others.


25 Amatory. Secret Memoirs of Louise, Crown Princess, The
    Court of Royal Saxony, 1891-1902. From the pages of her
    diary, lost at the time of her elopement from Dresden with W.
    Andre ("Richard") Giron. By Henry W. Fisher. Illustrated from
    photogravures, 1/2 vellum, board sides, gilt top and back, as
    issued. N. Y., 1912. =$5.00=

    This edition printed on Japanese vellum paper, is limited to
    250 copies only. UNEXPURGATED.

    If Louise had lived at the time of Phryne, the philosophers
    would have characterized her as "an animal with long hair,"
    if he had known her, the great Mirabean might have coined his
    pet phrase, "a human that dresses, undressed and talks" (or
    writes) for Louise; as a matter of fact, she is one of those
    "Jansenists" of love who believe in the utter helplessness of
    natural woman to turn down a good-looking man.

    laid deckle-edge paper. UNEXPURGATED. Cloth, 8vo. gilt tops,

    1/2 polished brown calf extra, gilt tooled backs, with green
    levant labels, gilt top. London, 1720. =$12.50=

    The works of Ovid having been some time translated, and met
    with so favorable a reception, the translator thought it would
    not be disagreeable to introduce a polite contemporary of his,
    in our language, one whom Ovid himself imitated, and for whom
    he had so great a value that he recommends his pupils in Art of
    Love, to read his works, and gather from them all the tender
    sentiments expressed of the tenderest of passions.




    ANTHROPOLOGICAL WORKS SOLD ONLY TO DOCTORS, LAWYERS, AND
    EDUCATORS.


28 Anthropology. (Davenport, John). Curiositates Eroticæ
    Physiologiæ, or, Tabooed subjects freely treated. Six Essays,
    vis.: Generation; Chastity and Modesty; Marriage; Circumcision;
    Eunuchism; Hermaphrodism, and followed by a closing essay
    on Death. Small 4to. 1/2 morocco, gilt top, uncut. London:
    Privately printed, 1875. =$15.00=

    Let it not be supposed that the author's intention has been
    that of writing an obscene book, or even to employ obscene
    words. He holds that the grand subject--the Reproduction of
    the Human Race--which runs more or less through all the essays
    in this volume, is, in itself, most pure, and that the words
    which are necessary, adequately, and correctly to describe
    it in its various phases and ramifications, have acquired
    the stigma of obscene only in modern times, and, though an
    ultra-fastidiousness, which would hesitate to apply the word
    breech to a man's small clothes, but would rather designate
    them as unmentionables, indescribables, or femoral habiliments.


29 Anthropology. Aphrodisiacs and Anti-aphrodisiacs: Three
    Essays on the Powers of Reproduction; with some account of
    the Judicial "Congress" as practised in France during the
    Seventeenth Century. By John Davenport. Illustrated. Small 4to.
    1/2 levant morocco extra, gilt tooled back, gilt top, uncut.
    London. Privately printed, 1869. =$15.00=

    The reproduction powers of nature were regarded by the nations
    of remote antiquity with an awe and reverence so great as to
    form an object of worship, under a symbol, of all others the
    most significant--the Phallus; and this was founded a religion,
    of which the traces exist to this day, not in Asia alone, but
    even in Europe itself.


30 Anthropology. Psychopathia Sexualis. With especial reference
    to the Antipathic Sexual Instinct. A Medico-Forensic Study. By
    Dr. R. V. Krafft-Ebing. Translated from the German by F. J.
    Rebman. 8vo. buckram. New York, 1910. =$3.50=

    Few people are conscious of the deep influence exerted in
    sexual life upon the sentiment, thought and action of man in
    his social relations to others. Shiller, in his essay, Die
    Weltweisen, touches upon this subject in these memorable words:
    "So long as philosophy keeps together the structure of the
    Universe so long does it maintain the world's machinery of
    hunger and love."


31 Anthropology. A Problem in Modern Ethics. Being an Inquiry
    into the Phenomenon of Sexual Inversion. Addressed especially
    to Medical Psychologists and Jurists. By John Addington
    Symonds. 8vo. cloth. London, privately printed, 1896. =$3.50=

    Limited to 100 numbered copies only.

    Inverted sexuality, the sexual instinct diverted from its
    normal channel, directed (in the case males) to males, forms
    the topic of this volume. The study will be confined to modern

32 Anthropology. A Problem in Greek Ethics. Being an Inquiry
    into the Phenomenon of Sexual Inversion. Addressed especially
    to Medical Psychologists and Jurists. By John Addington
    Symonds. 8vo. cloth. London, privately printed, 1901. =$3.50=

    Limited to 100 numbered copies only.

    For the student of sexual inversion, ancient Greece offers a
    wide field for observation and reflection. Its importance has
    hitherto been underrated by medical and legal writers on the
    subject, who do not seem to be aware that here alone in history
    have we the example of a great and highly-developed race not
    only tolerating homosexual passions, but deeming them of
    spiritual value, and attempting to utilize them for the benefit
    of society.


33 Anthropology. The Sexual Life of Woman, in its Physiological
    and Hygienic Aspect. By E. H. Kisch. Post 8vo. cloth. New York,
    1916. =$3.00=

    From the earliest days of the medical art this sexual life
    of woman has aroused in the leaders of medical thought the
    highest interest, and for this reason great attention has
    been directed, not only to the anatomy of the genital organs
    and to the diseases of the reproductive system, but also to
    the individual manifestations of sexual activity and to the
    influence exercised by these on the female organism as a whole.

    Psychological, Hygienic and Sociological Study. By August
    Forel. English adaptation, revised and enlarged, by C. F.
    Marshall. Illustrated. 8vo. cloth. New York, n. d. =$3.50=

    In the domain with which we are concerned the French public are
    too much afraid of crudities and of calling things by their
    proper name. By veiled words and by indirect locution one
    may say anything, but the author decided not to employ such
    subterfuges in treating of such a vital social question with
    the seriousness it requires.

    With numerous Editorial Notes and an Appendix. 8vo. cloth. New

    A vice which has been co-existent with the human race, which
    has prayed upon the morals as well as the health of all
    peoples in all ages, which in the past has defied the edicts
    of despotism no less than at present it defies the mandates of
    repressive legislation--such a vice should not in any spirit of
    prudery be put aside as unfit for public consideration.

    "The Nights" of Straparola consist of an exquisite and
    delightful collection of humorous, witty and mirthful
    conversations, tales and enigmas, including singing, music and
    dancing during the thirteen nights of the Carnival at Venice,
    as related by ten charming and accomplished damsels and several
    nobles, men of learning, illustrious and honorable gentlemen of
    note at the entertainments of merriment and pleasure given by
    the Princess Lucretia at her beautiful Palace at Murano.

    The masterpiece of Italian prose, The Pecorone of Ser Giovanni,
    ranks in celebrity with Boccaccio's Decameron. The great
    popularity of the Pecorone arose from the fact that the amorous
    stories of love, intrigue and adventure therein contained cover
    comparatively fresh ground. Shakespeare borrowed Falstaff from
    Ser Giovanni, and The Merchant of Venice is founded on the
    first novel of the Fourth Day.

    Faublas, by John Baptiste--Louvet de Couvary. Founded on

    A faithful reprint of the very rare, literal, unexpurgated
    translation of 1822, from the Paris edition of 1821, choicely
    printed on antique deckle-edged paper, and delightfully
    illustrated with numerous charming plates, etched by Louis
    Monzies from drawings by Paul Avril, printed on special paper.
    Complete in 4 vols. Newly bound in 3/4 morocco extra, gilt tops
    and backs, uncut. Edition strictly limited to 100 sets only.
    Privately printed for Societe des Bibliophiles, 1898. =$40.00=

135 Facetiae. The Life of Marianne; or, the Adventures of

    Original French. 12mo. New 1/2 polished brown calf extra, gilt
    tooled back, with red levant inlays, gilt top, uncut. London,
    1736. =$20.00=

    Was this history a mere fiction, very likely the form of it
    would have been different. Marianne's reflections would be
    neither so long nor so frequent. It would contain more facts
    and less morality; in short, the author would have indulged
    the universal inclination of the present age, which, in books
    of this kind, does not relish abundance of arguments and
    reflections.

    The above Collection of Plays needs no other recommendation
    than that they were writ by the incomparable Mrs. A. Behn;

    Mrs. Behn devoted herself to intrigue and writing for support;
    and, as she had a good person and much conversational talent,
    she became fashionable among the men of wit and pleasure of
    the time. She published three volumes of poems by Rochester,
    Etherege, Crisp, and others, with some poetry of her own; and
    wrote seventeen plays, the heartless licentiousness of which
    was disgraceful both to her sex and to the age which tolerated
    the performance of same.

    The colored plates, or Nature Prints, used in this work, are

    to the paper while the bodies are printed from engravings
    and afterward colored by hand. The making of such transfers
    is not original with the author, but it took a good deal of
    experimenting to so perfect process as to make the transfers,
    on account of their fidelity to detail and their durability,
    fit for use as illustrations in such a work. And what
    magnificent illustrations they are, embodying all the beauty
    and perfection of the specimens themselves!

<p class="blockquot">The feminine personage who occupies the principal place in this

<p class="blockquot">She will be loved neither by a monk, a prophet or a God. In
actual literature, this is an originality.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Rather she will be frankly a courtesan, the ardor and also the
pride of every human being who has vocation and who holds in
society a freely chosen place; she will have ambition to raise herself
to the highest point; she will not even imagine a need for excuse
or mystery in her life.</p>

M. Lederer. 8vo. cloth. Phila., 1911. <span class="linenum"><b>$1.00</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">The imaginative realism, the poetic psychology, of this story of
the abnormal Therese who kills her lover; of the simple-minded
Julien who becomes an accessory after the act for love of her, and
finally "let himself fall" into the river, having first dropped the body
of Colombel over, are gripping and intense.</p>

<p class="hangindent">22 Amatory. Two Deaths in the Bronx. By Donald Evans. 8vo.
boards, antique wove paper. Philadelphia, 1918. <span class="linenum"><b>$1.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">The modernism, mistakenly called Futurism, that in the Sonnets
from the Patagonian sometimes merely amazed, in the present
instance, stimulates and satisfies. The volume is a series of pitiless
photographs of profligate men and women who fritter away life,
seeking new pleasures, new sensations. It is a gallery of incurable
poseurs. A curious little volume.</p>


<p class="hangindent">22A Amatory. The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter. (Scenes de la

Rinaldo, the Doctor of Florence, a play in 5 acts. Chatterton, a 1-act
play. Sonnets.</p>

<p class="blockquot">These three plays and sixty-odd sonnets are written with lucidity
and emotion. A human heart throbs through them. The sonnets
have evoked a fine critical eulogy from the greatest student of the
Elizabethan sonnets (including Shakespeare's).</p>


<p class="hangindent">23A Amatory. The Lady with the Camellias. By Alexander Dumas,
fils. UNEXPURGATED EDITION. With portrait and several fine
etchings by Albert Lynch, printed on Japan vellum. 8vo. buckram,

culture and refinement, but ultimately followed the course of so many
others.</p>

<p class="hangindent">25 Amatory. Secret Memoirs of Louise, Crown Princess, The Court
of Royal Saxony, 1891-1902. From the pages of her diary, lost at
the time of her elopement from Dresden with W. Andre ("Richard")
Giron. By Henry W. Fisher. Illustrated from photogravures, &frac12;
vellum, board sides, gilt top and back, as issued. N. Y., 1912. <span class="linenum"><b>$5.00</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">This edition printed on Japanese vellum paper, is limited to 250
copies only. UNEXPURGATED.</p>

<p class="blockquot">If Louise had lived at the time of Phryne, the philosophers
would have characterized her as "an animal with long hair," if he had
known her, the great Mirabean might have coined his pet phrase,
"a human that dresses, undressed and talks" (or writes) for Louise;
as a matter of fact, she is one of those "Jansenists" of love who
believe in the utter helplessness of natural woman to turn down a
good-looking man.</p>

paper. UNEXPURGATED. Cloth, 8vo. gilt tops, New
York, 1912. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.00</b></span></p>

brown calf extra, gilt tooled backs, with green levant labels, gilt
top. London, 1720. <span class="linenum"><b>$12.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">The works of Ovid having been some time translated, and met
with so favorable a reception, the translator thought it would not
be disagreeable to introduce a polite contemporary of his, in our
language, one whom Ovid himself imitated, and for whom he had
so great a value that he recommends his pupils in Art of Love, to
read his works, and gather from them all the tender sentiments
expressed of the tenderest of passions.</p>

Generation; Chastity and Modesty; Marriage; Circumcision; Eunuchism;
Hermaphrodism, and followed by a closing essay on Death.

<p class="blockquot">Let it not be supposed that the author's intention has been that
of writing an obscene book, or even to employ obscene words. He
holds that the grand subject&mdash;the Reproduction of the Human Race&mdash;which
runs more or less through all the essays in this volume, is,
in itself, most pure, and that the words which are necessary, adequately,
and correctly to describe it in its various phases and ramifications,
have acquired the stigma of obscene only in modern times,
and, though an ultra-fastidiousness, which would hesitate to apply
the word breech to a man's small clothes, but would rather designate
them as unmentionables, indescribables, or femoral habiliments.</p>

morocco extra, gilt tooled back, gilt top, uncut. London. Privately

<p class="blockquot">The reproduction powers of nature were regarded by the nations
of remote antiquity with an awe and reverence so great as to form
an object of worship, under a symbol, of all others the most significant&mdash;the
Phallus; and this was founded a religion, of which the
traces exist to this day, not in Asia alone, but even in Europe itself.</p>


<p class="hangindent">30 Anthropology. Psychopathia Sexualis. With especial reference
to the Antipathic Sexual Instinct. A Medico-Forensic Study. By
Dr. R. V. Krafft-Ebing. Translated from the German by F. J. Rebman.
8vo. buckram. New York, 1910. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Few people are conscious of the deep influence exerted in sexual
life upon the sentiment, thought and action of man in his social
relations to others. Shiller, in his essay, Die Weltweisen, touches
upon this subject in these memorable words: "So long as philosophy
keeps together the structure of the Universe so long does it maintain
the world's machinery of hunger and love."</p>


<p class="hangindent">31 Anthropology. A Problem in Modern Ethics. Being an Inquiry

Symonds. 8vo. cloth. London, privately printed, 1896. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Limited to 100 numbered copies only.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Inverted sexuality, the sexual instinct diverted from its normal
channel, directed (in the case males) to males, forms the topic of this
volume. The study will be confined to modern times, and to those
nations which regard the phenomenon with religious detestation.</p>


<p class="hangindent">32 Anthropology. A Problem in Greek Ethics. Being an Inquiry

Medical Psychologists and Jurists. By John Addington Symonds.
8vo. cloth. London, privately printed, 1901. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Limited to 100 numbered copies only.</p>

<p class="blockquot">For the student of sexual inversion, ancient Greece offers a wide
field for observation and reflection. Its importance has hitherto
been underrated by medical and legal writers on the subject, who
do not seem to be aware that here alone in history have we the
example of a great and highly-developed race not only tolerating
homosexual passions, but deeming them of spiritual value, and attempting
to utilize them for the benefit of society.</p>


<p class="hangindent">33 Anthropology. The Sexual Life of Woman, in its Physiological
and Hygienic Aspect. By E. H. Kisch. Post 8vo. cloth. New
York, 1916. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.00</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">From the earliest days of the medical art this sexual life of
woman has aroused in the leaders of medical thought the highest
interest, and for this reason great attention has been directed, not
only to the anatomy of the genital organs and to the diseases of the
reproductive system, but also to the individual manifestations of
sexual activity and to the influence exercised by these on the female
organism as a whole.</p>

adaptation, revised and enlarged, by C. F. Marshall. Illustrated.
8vo. cloth. New York, n. d. <span class="linenum"><b>$3.50</b></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">In the domain with which we are concerned the French public
are too much afraid of crudities and of calling things by their proper
name. By veiled words and by indirect locution one may say anything,
but the author decided not to employ such subterfuges in
treating of such a vital social question with the seriousness it requires.</p>

numerous Editorial Notes and an Appendix. 8vo. cloth. New

<p class="blockquot">A vice which has been co-existent with the human race, which has
prayed upon the morals as well as the health of all peoples in all
ages, which in the past has defied the edicts of despotism no less
than at present it defies the mandates of repressive legislation&mdash;such
a vice should not in any spirit of prudery be put aside as unfit
for public consideration.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The Nights" of Straparola consist of an exquisite and delightful
collection of humorous, witty and mirthful conversations, tales and
enigmas, including singing, music and dancing during the thirteen
nights of the Carnival at Venice, as related by ten charming and
accomplished damsels and several nobles, men of learning, illustrious
and honorable gentlemen of note at the entertainments of
merriment and pleasure given by the Princess Lucretia at her
beautiful Palace at Murano.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The masterpiece of Italian prose, The Pecorone of Ser Giovanni,
ranks in celebrity with Boccaccio's Decameron. The great popularity
of the Pecorone arose from the fact that the amorous
stories of love, intrigue and adventure therein contained cover
comparatively fresh ground. Shakespeare borrowed Falstaff from
Ser Giovanni, and The Merchant of Venice is founded on the first
novel of the Fourth Day.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Was this history a mere fiction, very likely the form of it would
have been different. Marianne's reflections would be neither so long

short, the author would have indulged the universal inclination of
the present age, which, in books of this kind, does not relish abundance
of arguments and reflections.</p>
